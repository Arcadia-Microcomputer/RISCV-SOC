Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2549 - The register "QSPI0/FlashControler0/r_Flash_O_2" has the
   property IOB=TRUE, but was not packed into the OLOGIC component. The output
   signal for register symbol QSPI0/FlashControler0/r_Flash_O_2 requires general
   routing to fabric, but the register can only be routed to ILOGIC, IODELAY,
   and IOB.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <CPU0/GLOBAL_LOGIC0> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
